Nevertheless, that impression is quite false. This is really not how forecloseds properties work. Especially if the home needs repair work. Your strategy of a fix-up cost and the bank's assessment could be two different thoughts.When you watch TV news reports that sensationalize foreclosures or read headlines that foreclosure filings are actually increasing, it is truly normal to jump to the opinion that banks are desperate.People have the tendency to believe that banks will do anything to unload foreclosures, including letting you buy properties for 50 percent of their value or less. Not true, in most instances.The reason that the Value of a Foreclosure Can Certainly Appear CheapAnyone could purchase a foreclosure generally for much less than its original loan balance, especially in a declining market. But that doesn't mean the bank will sell the property for less than market value. The market value might be 50 percent less than the last time the home sold, but that foreclosure price will generally reflect the value of the homes around it, less fix-up costs.In case you find a foreclosed properties promoted in MLS, it's at market value for its condition and location. This is definitely not a steal. However the perception that foreclosures are a "steal" persist, regardless. Probably because there are some exceptions to the rule.Exactly where to Locate a Cheap Foreclosure to BuyI often get calls from investors asking me about purchasing a foreclosure cheaply, and the truth is it's rare to find such a listing in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS).Every so often, if you're very lucky and very fast to write an offer, you might be able to buy a foreclosure for a little bit under the comparable sales. But bargain-basement deals are typically not listed in the MLS. Well, they are, but they aren't foreclosures.That's because banks, like any other seller, want to make as much money as possible.They hire real estate agents to prepare an estimate of value and tell them how much they can get. The agent takes the condition of the home into consideration and names a price. Then other agents in the MLS compete to buy that home for their buyers.When buyers compete, multiple offers are the result. Multiple offers tend to drive up the price. To find a cheap foreclosure, buyers need to reduce the competition for that foreclosure. Here are three places to search for cheap foreclosures.Buy a cheap foreclosure at a trustee's or sheriff's auction.You can find notices of auctions online and in local newspapers. There are a number of websites that post information on auctions, and some such as Property Radar might offer a free 30-day trial.You typically pay cash at public auctions and buy the home in its "as is" condition. Smart buyers pay a title company to complete a preliminary search before bidding. If there are liens such as taxes, delinquent homeowners association (HOA) dues or superior loans, those encumbrances stay with the home.There will be the sharks and pros at public auctions, and they will probably win the house, not you.Buy a cheap foreclosure at a private online auction.Auction houses generally advertise in newspapers and online.These marketing guys might travel more or less the nation holding auctions at hotels and resorts. An exclusive auction house frequently will definitely let you obtain financing to buy a cheap foreclosure. You can also bring a buyer's agent to represent you.Some auction companies will let you inspect the foreclosures prior to bidding. But you should be prepared to set a limit and be careful to not get carried away by the excitement created during the bidding process. Otherwise, you can overpay for that cheap foreclosure. Some online auctions charge you a percentage premium to buy.Buy a cheap foreclosure directly from the bank.The best way to eliminate the majority of the competing buyers for a cheap foreclosure is to contact the bank directly. Banks are frequently inclined to provide a break on the price in case a buyer/investor purchases more than one home in a bulk-purchase bundle.What you will find more often compared to not is the bank does not want to sell to you. If the home is not on sale, but it's bank-owned, it's probably because there are tax advantages to the bank not to sell it.Some financial institutions keep a list of foreclosure properties online that are available to purchase. Buyers can additionally check the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website for a list of HUD-owned homes., <BR><BR><center> <strong>For details, please contact (949) 610-5720
